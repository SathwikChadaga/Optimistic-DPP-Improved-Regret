## Files Description
- `dpop_regret.ipynb` runs the experiment for different values of time horizon and shows the regret curve.
- `regret_sweep.ipynb` shows the regret for different levels of noise and arrival rates.
- `dpop_run.ipynb` runs the experiment for a given time horizon and shows the resulting backlogs and costs.
- `plot_results.ipynb` plots the saved results (use after saving the results from previous programs).
- `utils/` contains utility files required to run the above programs.
